export CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
```

## Examples

The `examples/` folder contains sample scripts demonstrating various use cases with the Cisco Secure Access SDK:

### Access Rule Backup and Restore
Backup and restore access rules
```sh
python examples/access_rule_backup_restore.py -h
usage: access_rule_backup_restore.py [-h] -t {backup,restore} [-o OFFSET] [-l LIMIT] [-r RULES [RULES ...]]

Utility to backup and restore access rules

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t {backup,restore}, --type {backup,restore}
                        Type of the operation to be performed i.e. either backup or restore the access rules.
  -o OFFSET, --offset OFFSET
                        Starting offset to fetch the access rules
  -l LIMIT, --limit LIMIT
                        limit to fetch the access rules in a call
  -r RULES [RULES ...], --rules RULES [RULES ...]
                        list of rule id's to filter the Access Rules
```

### Roaming Computers Backup
Backup roaming computer configurations
```sh

                                   [--last-sync-after LAST_SYNC_AFTER] [--filter-key FILTER_KEY] [--filter-value FILTER_VALUE]
                                   [--filter-expression FILTER_EXPRESSION] [--backup-file BACKUP_FILE] [--apply-simple-filter]
                                   [--apply-complex-filter]
