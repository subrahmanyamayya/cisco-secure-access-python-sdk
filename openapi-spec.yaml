        A co-occurrence is when two or more domains are accessed by the same users
        within a small window of time.

        Co-occurring domains are not necessarily problematic; legitimate sites co-occur
        with each other as a part

        of normal web activity. However, unusual or suspicious co-occurences can provide
        additional information regarding attacks.

        To determine co-occurrences for a domain, a small time window of traffic across
        all of our datacenters is taken.

        Investigate checks the sites that end users visited before and after the domain
        was requested in the API call.'

        The popularity list contains our most queried domains based on passive DNS
        usage across

        the Secure Access global network of more than 180 billion requests per day
        with many tens of millions

        of unique active users, in more than 165 countries.

        The metric does not only consist of browser-based http requests from users
        but also takes

        in to account the number of unique client IPs invoking this domain relative
        to the sum of all requests

        to all domains.

        Our popularity ranking reflects the domain''s relative internet activity agnostic

        to the invocation protocols and applications where as site ranking models
        (such as Alexa) focus

        on the web activity over port 80 (primarily from browsers).

        In addition, the Secure Access popularity algorithm also applies data normalization
        techniques

        to smooth potential biases that may occur due to sampling of DNS usage data.

      description: 'Get the WHOIS information for the specified email addresses,

        nameservers, and domains. You can search by multiple email addresses or multiple
        nameservers.

        This documentation outlines the following API endpoints:

        email (single and multiple), domain record (current and historical), and nameserver
        (single and multiple).

        In some instances, WHOIS information can be irregular as there are no standards

        between domain registrars and large volumes of information can be returned
        from a query.

        As such, both the email and nameserver WHOIS endpoints have a limit of 500
        results,

        which you can reduce to a smaller set of results.

        There is an `offset` parameter that can be leveraged to retrieve the entire
        set

        of domain entries for a given email without any limitation. Only the email
        parameter

        supports this.

        You can sort the email parameter by filtering the entries based on the timestamp
        field.

        If a domain, email, or nameserver has no known WHOIS information, Investigate
        returns `HTTP 404`.

        If a domain, email or nameserver does not exist, Investigate returns `HTTP
        404`.

          field to `false`.

          with the `access` type of `thirdparty_block`.

          * You must set the `bundleTypeId` to `2`. Web profiles are applied on your
          policy rules.

          * Each fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that you add in a destination
          list must contain no more than 253 characters.


          If you make an API request on the POST operation that adds a URL on a high-volume
          domain to a destination list,

          the operation may succeed (`HTTP/200 OK`).

          However, the server returns an error message (`HTTP/400 Bad Request`) that
          indicates that the destination is on a high-volume domain.

          **Note:** Secure Access does not add URLs that are on high-volume domains
          to destination lists. Instead, we recommend that you add the domain only.'

          * Each API request accepts no more than 500 destination objects in the body
          of the request unless the destination list is of type `thirdparty_block`.

          * If the type of the destination list is `thirdparty_block`, then the system

          If you make an API request on the POST operation that adds a URL on a high-volume
          domain to a destination list,

          the operation may succeed (`HTTP/200 OK`).

          However, the server returns an error message (`HTTP/400 Bad Request`) that
          indicates that the destination is on a high-volume domain.

          **Note:** Secure Access does not add URLs that are on high-volume domains
          to destination lists. Instead, we recommend that you add the domain only.'
